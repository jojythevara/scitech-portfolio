# Hi, I'm Jojy Thevara
Welcome to my ICS4U portfolio. I’ll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## Projects
- 🔧 Game Description: Chemical Warfare is a two-player local competitive “paint the map" territory game where you’re tasked to color more of the map compared to your opponent with your respective color. There will be            special power-ups (e.g. speed-boost, increased size) which would aid you in order to complete the final object which is to color in the most at the end of the time limit.
